# Places to see in Orange County California

I recommend Laguna Beach if you only have time for one location, Newport comes second.

If you split it up between two days then I recommend Laguna Beach then Dana Point one day; Newport then Huntington on the other.

Below locations are ordered from South to North.

## Dana Point

- **Dana Point Harbor:** There are some decent restaurants here, but a nice place to walk with gorgeous views. There are [sea lions](http://www.seecalifornia.com/beaches/dana-point-seals-sealions.html), a harbor, restaurants, and shopping. I recommend entering from the north and driving down [Cove Road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2QSe9CMMbbY6tEx5A). ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C3HEEomwKkTuiT5G7))

## Laguna Beach

This is a must see city. It is closest to Irvine, and during the off peak season is very quick to get to with low traffic.

- **Top of the World:** This location gives you an incredible view of the surrounding area and coastline. There are also a hiking trails if you'd like but the view alone from the trail head is worth a 10 minute stop. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfGSyEjYJq8TU2AU9))
- **The Cliff Restaurant:** Decent food but an amazing view. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hSdDPvy6Ge3AcKKt9))
- **Rooftop Lounge:** Great spot for drinks with amazing views. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ufaV6zRLtrTtKAFx9))
- **Main Beach:** The central beach, has a park. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PPbr3d3fr889atxYA))
- **Ocean Ave:** Great shopping area to explore. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7bFDqL25tDJo5AGe8))
- **Beach Walk:** This is a must see walk along the cliff overseeing the coastline. It features several art installations. You can start at the Hesler Park Gazebo. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dip1BQUj7YsovjXH9))
- **Crystal Cove State Park Vista Point:** A very easy hiking trail along the coastal cliff. Drive here from downtown Laguna to get a great view from Pacific Coast Highway. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RyFavPfE2VMCeuqt6))

## Newport Beach

- **Corona Del Mar:** This is the wealthiest section of Newport Beach. Some shopping and dining, but the beach area is gorgeous. ([Google Map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/D6gyi7MHHjcatggL6))
- **Balboa Island:** This is a small island with a lot of compact houses. It is cool to walk around the perimeter and check out the water. They have a small town in the center. Not the most exciting place ever but worth a drive through it on you're way to the peninsula ferry. You can skip this place and go to Fashion Island instead, then head over to Balboa Peninsula from the main highway instead of using the ferry.

- **Balboa Peninsula:** This is an iconic area in Newport Beach. You can take the ferry in your car from Balboa Island for cheap, it is a very short ride and inexpensive. There is a boardwalk and several beaches, bars, shopping, and restaurants.
I recommend checking out the areas by each pier and Lido Marina Village. If you like sushi Lido Marina Village has a [Nobu](https://noburestaurants.com/newportbeach/home) location (but expect to pay a few hundred dollars or more on dinner lol)

- **Fashion Island:** This is a famous outdoor mall. Worth taking a quick walk to check out the high end boutique shops. There is a Koi Pond and a Tesla store :D. ([Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AMEQcjGxirciberLA))

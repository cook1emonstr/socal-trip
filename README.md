# Places to see in Orange County California

I recommend Laguna Beach if you only have time for one location, Newport comes second.

If you split it up between two days then I recommend Laguna beach then Dana Point one day; Newport then Huntington on the other.

Below is ordered from most Southern to most Northern.

## Dana Point

### Dana Point Harbor

There are some decent restaurants here, but a nice place to walk with gorgeous views. There are [Sea Lions](http://www.seecalifornia.com/beaches/dana-point-seals-sealions.html), a harbor, restaurants, and shopping. I recommend entering from the north and driving down [Cove Road](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2QSe9CMMbbY6tEx5A).

## Laguna Beach

This is a must see city. It is closest to Irvine, and during the off peak season is very quick to get to with low traffic.

### Top of the World

This location gives you an incredible view of the surrounding area and coastline. There are also a hiking trails if you'd like but the view alone from the trail head is worth a 10 minute stop.
